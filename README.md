# Lab-in-Image-processing
In this project, you will develop an algorithm to detect and extract license plates from vehicle images.
The algorithm should process an image containing at least one license plate and produce a binary image with the license plate(s) highlighted against a black background, ensuring that the pixels of the license plate remain unaltered. The approach involves designing a method to isolate license plates based on their distinct features, using sample images (plate01-plate05) for testing and refinement. The final algorithm should accurately generate binary masks and handle additional images, with the goal of successfully processing at least 5 out of 15 additional test images provided by the instructor. A bonus is awarded for achieving success with 10 or more images.
